# AWS websocket example

During innovation week at work I decided to do some hands on from-the-ground-up work on implementing websockets in aws. This also ended up being an intro-to-building-via-serverless project for me. I've worked in serverless codebases for years now, but I've never set one up from scratch and I didn't know some of the nuances of building with serverless (hard to get those exp points when you work in projects that are already setup :/ ).

So, this codebase for me is:
- Setting up a serverless project from scratch
- Building out the infrastructure needed for a simple websocket setup using api gateway, lambdas, and dynamodb 
- Learning the serverless cli tools, _maybe_ diving into the serverless application model if there's enough time
